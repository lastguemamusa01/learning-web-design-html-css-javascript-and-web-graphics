User Experience, Interaction and User Interface design

Ofter, when we think of design, we think about how something looks. 
for the web, must importat is designing how the site works. 
before you pick colors and fonts, it is important to identify the site's goals.
how it will be used and how visitors move through it -> Ux(User Experience) design, Interaction Design(IxD), and UI(User Interface) Design

UXD(User Experience Design) - takes a holistic view of the desing process - ensuring the entire experience with the site is favorable.
based on a solid understanding of users and their needs based on observations and interviews. 
"all aspects of the user's iteraction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used" for web site or application.
( visual design, the user interface, the queality and message of the content, and even the overall site performance)

Interaction Desiger - (goal) make the site as easy, efficient and delightful to use as possible. 

(UID)User Itnteface Design - tends to be more narrowly focused on the functional organization of the page as well as the specific tools(buttons, links, menus, etc)
that users use to navaigate content or accomplish tasks.

## UX, UI and Interaction Desingers produces :

User Reserach and testing reports - User Centerd design(UCD) - understanding the needs, desires and limitations of users is central to the success of the design of the site or web application. user research(interviews and observations), to gain better undesting. do user testing(to test usability and is for testing if the user is having hard time to found some content or some element)


Wireframe diagrams - shows the structure of a web page using only outlines for each content type and widget. (prototying or maquet, very abstract)

storyboards and user flow charts - 
storyboard - traces the path through a site or appliation from the point of view of a typical user. usually includes a script and scenes consisting of screen views or the user interacting with the screen.

user flow charts - another method for showing how the parts of a site or application are connected.(focus technical details rather telling a story)
"when the user does this, it triggers that funcion on the server"


## Visual(graphic) design

visual presentation. graphic designer creates the look and feel of the site(logos, graphics, type, colors, layout and so on)
site can make good first impression and is consistent with the brand and message of the organization it represents.

sketches or mocks-ups(created in photoshop or a similiar tool) (colors, fonts, image style, etc)

after detailed decided, you can proceed with prototypes.

need to know how to optimize images for the fastest delivery and how to addresss the requierements of varying screen sizes.
also development team to handle image optimization.

designer may also be responsible creating a style guid that documents style choices(fonts, colors, etc) for site consistency.

HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language - is a system for identifying and describing the various components of a docuemnt. structure of the document.
used to describe the content in a web page

CSS - descirbe how that content should look. 

Javascript - (js and dom scripting) - a script language that adds interactivity and behaviors to web pages.
DOM - Document Object Model - standarized list of web page elements that can be accessed and manipulated using JS or another script language.

css framework(boostrap)
js framework (react, angular, others)
AJAX(Asynchronous jascript and xml) - technique used to load content in the background, allowing the page to update smoothly without reloading

backend developer focus on the server. application and databases. 
server side programming languages (PHP, ruby, .net asp.net, python, jsp)
database no sql, sql(mysql, oracle, sql server)

Soft Skills
* excellent communication skills
* flexibility
* critical thiking and good judgement
* a good attitude


browsers work differently on macs than windows and linux. also for each brwosers(safari, google chrome, etc)

mobile devices for testing, or use browser to mimic the size or sites that testing multiple screen sizes simulataniously.

ide - color coding, error detection, suggestion to finish.

**User interface and layout tools

* Sketch (sketchapp.com)
* Adobe XD
* Figma

**Web graphic creation tools

* Adobe Crweative Cloud suite 
* photoshop
* GIMP (open sources)
* Corel Draw and paintshop pro
* SumoPaint
* Pixlr

**A variety of browsers

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Ms Edge
* Safari
* Opera
* browsers for mobile phones (ios safary, android brosers, third-party mobile brosers)

**File management and transfer tools

* FTP - to upload file (Filezila, Transmit)
* Terminal
* Gygwin (linuxx emulator for windows)


**The internet versus the web

internet - is an international network of connected computers.
purpose of sharing information.

ways of sharing information :

* email(POP3, IMAP/SMTP)
* file transter(FTP)
* secure shell(SSH)
* many more (standardized methods for transferring data or documents over a netwrok are know as protocols)

web -originally called the World Wide Web as www, is just one of the ways information can be shared over the internet.
The web uses a protocl called HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS

server - is the software(no thte computer itself) that allows the computer to communicate with other computers.

web servers are aslo called HTTP servers

server software options

* Apache
* Microsfot Internet Information Services(IIS)

every computer and device connect to interned has IP address(Internet Protocol)
Domain Name System(DNS) to allow us to refer to that server by its domain name "google.com"
domain name - for human redability
ip addres is more useful for computer software
DNS server - mattching the text domain names to there respective numeric ip addresses.
ip adrees is like phone number
dns server is like phone book

**a word about browsers

clinet - the softare that does the requestiong.
server - returns the document for the browser(user agent)

the request and response are handled via the https protocols

think about users with impaired sight may be listening to a web page ready by a screen reader.

intranet - internet with firewall, internal organization
extranet - internet, but allows access to select users outside of the organization.

technology

server-side - run server computer, backend
client-side - run user machine, front end

**Browser Rendering Engines

rendering engine(browser or layout engine) - program that is responsible for converting html and css into what you see rendered on the screen.

chrom - blink
firfox - gecko
safari and safari ios - webkit
ms edge - endgeHtml
opera - blink

why pages may look and perfrom differently from browser to browser - varying spport for web technologies, varying device capabilities, and the users ability to set their own browsing preferences.

**Web Page Addresses(URLS)

web has own special address called a URL(Unifirm Resource Locator)

url has the protocol, site name and absolute path to the document or resource.

protocol : http://
name of the site:  www.example.com
  hostname : www (this can be ommited)
  domain name: example.com
  subdomain: client.example.com , developer.example.com
absolute path: /2018/samples/first.html
  directory path : /2018/samples/
  document: first.html

URI - 
URL IS ONE TYPE OF A uri that identifies the resource by its location (L) on the network. 
other that or URI is URN that identifies the resource by name or namespace (N)

** Simplified URLs

https://www.oreily.com/index.html -> oreilly.com

Skipping the protocol -  http:// part is often just implied, additionally, browsers are programmed to add http:// automatically.

Pointing to default files - depend of server is configured, but index is typically default.  canbe be default.aspx, index.php, default.htm

https - https with secure, encripts form information when it is sent between the user's client and server. any web page that has form fields that accept text(such as a search bar or a login) should use HTTPS

SSL(Secure Socket Layer) - NEED TO BE ENABLED ON THE SERVER FOR SECURE TRANSACTIONS TO WORK. 

404 error - when page cannot be found.

server looks for the requested file and issues an http response in the form of an HTTP header. the header includes information about the file, like the last modified date, the length of the file, and its Content-Type : text/html

**Static vs Dynamic Sites

static websites - html with fixed content that display the same information to every visitor(landing page) (caching)

dynamic websites - are generated with backend programming. each page is generated by the application on the fly.
database and customized for each user. 

**some big concepts you need to know

The heart of the matter is that as web designers, we never know exactly how the pages we create will be viewed. We don’t know which of the dozens of browsers might be used, whether it is on a desktop computer or some- thing more portable, how large the browser window will be, what fonts are installed, whether functionality such as JavaScript is enabled, how fast the internet connection is, whether the pages are being read by a screen reader, and so on. 

***a multitude of devices

Internet speed can be 3g , wifi 
Devices : monitor, laptops, ipad or tablet or smartphone, tv, cars, gaming console, smart refrigerator
Depende the multiple browsers : safari, chrome, Edge, firefox, etc

***sticking with the standards

Sticking with web standards is your primary tool for ensuring yoursite is as consistent as possible. 

A good start is to follow the standards documented by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Sticking with web standards is your primary tool for ensuring your site is consistent on all stan- dards-compliant browsers (that’s approximately 99% of browsers in current use). 
Another benefit is that you can tell your cli- ents that you create “standards-compliant” sites, and they will like you more. 

* The W3C site (w3.org/standards) is the primary resource for all web stan- dards documents.
