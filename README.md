## Web Design

wordpress, wix, squarespace, wix, sitebuilder, weebly - option to drage and drop. provides templates

for small scale project, you can use a template and tweak the underlying code.



Information Architect(Designer) - organizes the content logically and for ease of findability. responsible for search funcionality,
site diagrams, and how the content and data are organized on the server.

Content Strategist - make sure that every bit of text on a site, from long explanatory text down to the labels on buttons,
supports the brand identity and marketing goals of the organization. data modeling and content management, planning for content reuse and update schedules.

## Designer roles

User Experience, Interaction and User Interface design

Ofter, when we think of design, we think about how something looks. 
for the web, must importat is designing how the site works. 
before you pick colors and fonts, it is important to identify the site's goals.
how it will be used and how visitors move through it -> Ux(User Experience) design, Interaction Design(IxD), and UI(User Interface) Design

UXD(User Experience Design) - takes a holistic view of the desing process - ensuring the entire experience with the site is favorable.
based on a solid understanding of users and their needs based on observations and interviews. 
"all aspects of the user's iteraction with the product: how it is perceived, learned, and used" for web site or application.
( visual design, the user interface, the queality and message of the content, and even the overall site performance)

Interaction Desiger - (goal) make the site as easy, efficient and delightful to use as possible. 

(UID)User Itnteface Design - tends to be more narrowly focused on the functional organization of the page as well as the specific tools(buttons, links, menus, etc)
that users use to navaigate content or accomplish tasks.

## UX, UI and Interaction Desingers produces :

User Reserach and testing reports - User Centerd design(UCD) - understanding the needs, desires and limitations of users is central to the success of the design of the site or web application. user research(interviews and observations), to gain better undesting. do user testing(to test usability and is for testing if the user is having hard time to found some content or some element)


Wireframe diagrams - shows the structure of a web page using only outlines for each content type and widget. (prototying or maquet, very abstract)

storyboards and user flow charts - 
storyboard - traces the path through a site or appliation from the point of view of a typical user. usually includes a script and scenes consisting of screen views or the user interacting with the screen.

user flow charts - another method for showing how the parts of a site or application are connected.(focus technical details rather telling a story)
"when the user does this, it triggers that funcion on the server"


## Visual(graphic) design

visual presentation. graphic designer creates the look and feel of the site(logos, graphics, type, colors, layout and so on)
site can make good first impression and is consistent with the brand and message of the organization it represents.

sketches or mocks-ups(created in photoshop or a similiar tool) (colors, fonts, image style, etc)

after detailed decided, you can proceed with prototypes.

need to know how to optimize images for the fastest delivery and how to addresss the requierements of varying screen sizes.
also development team to handle image optimization.

designer may also be responsible creating a style guid that documents style choices(fonts, colors, etc) for site consistency.

HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language - is a system for identifying and describing the various components of a docuemnt. structure of the document.
used to describe the content in a web page

CSS - descirbe how that content should look. 

Javascript - (js and dom scripting) - a script language that adds interactivity and behaviors to web pages.
DOM - Document Object Model - standarized list of web page elements that can be accessed and manipulated using JS or another script language.

css framework(boostrap)
js framework (react, angular, others)
AJAX(Asynchronous jascript and xml) - technique used to load content in the background, allowing the page to update smoothly without reloading

backend developer focus on the server. application and databases. 
server side programming languages (PHP, ruby, .net asp.net, python, jsp)
database no sql, sql(mysql, oracle, sql server)


Product Manager - guides its design and development in a way that meets business goals. develop the overall strategy for the site from a marketing perspective,including how and when it gets released.

Project Manager - coordinates the disegners, develoeprs and stakeholders. manage like timelines, development approaches, deliverables, and so on.
project manager works with the product manager and other product owners to make sure that the project gets done on time and on budget.

* photoshop
* GIMP (open sources)
* Corel Draw and paintshop pro
* SumoPaint
* Pixlr

## A variety of browsers

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Ms Edge

* Opera
* browsers for mobile phones (ios safary, android brosers, third-party mobile brosers)

## File management and transfer tools

* FTP - to upload file (Filezila, Transmit)
* Terminal
* Gygwin (linuxx emulator for windows)


## The internet versus the web

internet - is an international network of connected computers.
purpose of sharing information.

ways of sharing information :

* email(POP3, IMAP/SMTP)
* file transter(FTP)
* secure shell(SSH)
* many more (standardized methods for transferring data or documents over a netwrok are know as protocols)

web -originally called the World Wide Web as www, is just one of the ways information can be shared over the internet.
The web uses a protocl called HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS

server - is the software(no thte computer itself) that allows the computer to communicate with other computers.

web servers are aslo called HTTP servers

server software options

* Apache
* Microsfot Internet Information Services(IIS)

every computer and device connect to interned has IP address(Internet Protocol)
Domain Name System(DNS) to allow us to refer to that server by its domain name "google.com"
domain name - for human redability
ip addres is more useful for computer software
DNS server - mattching the text domain names to there respective numeric ip addresses.
ip adrees is like phone number
dns server is like phone book

## a word about browsers

clinet - the softare that does the requestiong.
server - returns the document for the browser(user agent)

the request and response are handled via the https protocols

think about users with impaired sight may be listening to a web page ready by a screen reader.

intranet - internet with firewall, internal organization
extranet - internet, but allows access to select users outside of the organization.

technology

server-side - run server computer, backend
client-side - run user machine, front end

## Browser Rendering Engines

rendering engine(browser or layout engine) - program that is responsible for converting html and css into what you see rendered on the screen.

chrom - blink
firfox - gecko
safari and safari ios - webkit
ms edge - endgeHtml
opera - blink

why pages may look and perfrom differently from browser to browser - varying spport for web technologies, varying device capabilities, and the users ability to set their own browsing preferences.

## Web Page Addresses(URLS)

web has own special address called a URL(Unifirm Resource Locator)

url has the protocol, site name and absolute path to the document or resource.

protocol : http://
name of the site:  www.example.com
  hostname : www (this can be ommited)
  domain name: example.com
  subdomain: client.example.com , developer.example.com
absolute path: /2018/samples/first.html
  directory path : /2018/samples/
  document: first.html

URI - 
URL IS ONE TYPE OF A uri that identifies the resource by its location (L) on the network. 
other that or URI is URN that identifies the resource by name or namespace (N)

## Simplified URLs

https://www.oreily.com/index.html -> oreilly.com

Skipping the protocol -  http:// part is often just implied, additionally, browsers are programmed to add http:// automatically.

Pointing to default files - depend of server is configured, but index is typically default.  canbe be default.aspx, index.php, default.htm

https - https with secure, encripts form information when it is sent between the user's client and server. any web page that has form fields that accept text(such as a search bar or a login) should use HTTPS

SSL(Secure Socket Layer) - NEED TO BE ENABLED ON THE SERVER FOR SECURE TRANSACTIONS TO WORK. 

404 error - when page cannot be found.

server looks for the requested file and issues an http response in the form of an HTTP header. the header includes information about the file, like the last modified date, the length of the file, and its Content-Type : text/html

## Static vs Dynamic Sites

static websites - html with fixed content that display the same information to every visitor(landing page) (caching)

dynamic websites - are generated with backend programming. each page is generated by the application on the fly.
database and customized for each user. 

## some big concepts you need to know

The heart of the matter is that as web designers, we never know exactly how the pages we create will be viewed. We don’t know which of the dozens of browsers might be used, whether it is on a desktop computer or some- thing more portable, how large the browser window will be, what fonts are installed, whether functionality such as JavaScript is enabled, how fast the internet connection is, whether the pages are being read by a screen reader, and so on. 

### a multitude of devices

Internet speed can be 3g , wifi 
Devices : monitor, laptops, ipad or tablet or smartphone, tv, cars, gaming console, smart refrigerator
Depende the multiple browsers : safari, chrome, Edge, firefox, etc

### sticking with the standards

Sticking with web standards is your primary tool for ensuring yoursite is as consistent as possible. 

A good start is to follow the standards documented by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Sticking with web standards is your primary tool for ensuring your site is consistent on all stan- dards-compliant browsers (that’s approximately 99% of browsers in current use). 
Another benefit is that you can tell your cli- ents that you create “standards-compliant” sites, and they will like you more. 

* The W3C site (w3.org/standards) is the primary resource for all web stan- dards documents.

### PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT

With a multitude of browsers comes a multitude of levels of support for the web standards. In fact, no browser has implemented all the standards 100%
Progressive enhancement is one strategy for dealing with unknown browser capabilities (see Note). When designing with progressive enhancement, you start with a baseline experience that makes the content or core functionality available to even the most rudimentary browsers or assistive devices. From there, you layer on more advanced features for the browsers that can handle them. You might finish with some “nice to have” effects, like animation or wrapping text around images in interesting shapes, that enhance the experi- ence for users with the most advanced browsers, but aren’t really critical to the brand or message.

Progressive enhancement is the flip side of an approach to browser diversity called graceful degradation, in which you design the fully enhanced experience first, then create a series of fallbacks for non-supporting browsers. Both methods have their place in modern development. You will find many fallback techniques suggested in this book to be sure less capable browsers are accommodated.

#### Authoring strategy

When an HTML document is written in logical order and its elements are marked up in a meaningful way, it will be usable on the widest range of browsing environments, including the oldest browsers, future brows- ers, and mobile and assistive devices. It may not look exactly the same, but the important thing is that your content is available. It also ensures that search engines like Google will catalog the content correctly

#### Styling strategy

You can create layers of experience simply by taking advantage of the way browsers parse style sheet rules. Without going into too much technical detail, you can write a style rule that makes an element background red, but also include a style that gives it a cool gradient (a blend from one color to another) for browsers that know how to render gradients. Or you can use a cutting-edge CSS selector to deliver certain styles only to cutting-edge browsers. The knowledge that browsers simply ignore prop- erties and rules they don’t understand gives you license to innovate with- out bringing older browsers to their knees. You just have to be mindful of styling the baseline experience first, then adding improvements once the minimum requirements are met.

#### Scripting strategy

As with other web technologies, there are discrepancies in how browsers handle JavaScript (particularly on non-desktop devices), and some users opt to turn it off entirely. The first rule in progressive enhancement is to make sure basic functionality—such as linking from page to page or accomplishing essential tasks like data submission via forms—is intact even when JavaScript is off. In this way, you ensure the baseline experi- ence, and enhance it when JavaScript is available.

There is no better introduction to the progressive enhancement approach than the book Adaptive Web Design: Crafting Rich Experiences with Progressive Enhancement, 2nd Edition, by Aaron Gustafson (New Riders).

## RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN

Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a strategy for providing appropriate layouts to devices based on the size of the viewport (browser window). The key to Responsive Web Design is serving a single HTML document (with one URL) to all devices, but applying different style sheets based on the screen size in order to provide the most optimized layout for that device

responsive web design example : Media Queries gallery site (mediaqueri.es)


Responsive Web Design helps with matters of layout, but it is not a solution to all mobile web design challenges. The fact is that providing the best experi- ences for your users and their chosen device may require optimizations that go beyond adjusting the look and feel. You can better address some problems by using the server to detect the device and its capabilities and then making decisions on what to send back.

For some sites and services, it may be preferable to build a separate mobile site (see the “M-dot Sites” sidebar) with a customized interface and feature set that takes advantage of phone capabilities like geolocation. 

M-dot Sites
Some companies and services choose to build an entirely separate site, with
a unique URL, just for mobile devices. M-dot sites (named because their URLs typically begin with “m.” or “mobile.”) offer a reduced set of options and may also include mobile-specific features such as geolocation. A lot of the “extra” stuff (like promotions) from the desktop site is simply stripped away. (It makes you wonder what value it adds on the desktop.) A dedicated mobile site may be the best solution if you know that your mobile users have very different usage patterns than folks seated at a desk.

dot sites are fading away in favor of RWD. Google is helping to speed this process along by encouraging all m-dot sites to migrate to RWD before the launch of their “mobile- first index”
 
 ## one web for all( accessibility)
 
We’ve only addressed visual browsers controlled with mouse pointers or fingertips. It is critical, however, to keep in mind that people access the web in many different ways—with a keyboard, mouse, voice commands, screen readers, Braille output, magnifiers, joysticks, foot pedals, and so on. Web designers must build pages in a manner that creates as few barriers as pos- sible to getting to information, regardless of the user’s ability and the device used to access the web. In other words, you must design for accessibility.

Although intended for users with disabilities such as poor vision or limited mobility, the techniques and strategies developed for accessibility also benefit other users with less-than-optimum browsing experiences. Accessible sites are also more effectively indexed by search engines such as Google. Making your site accessible is well worth the extra effort.

There are four broad categories of disabilities that affect how people interact with their computers and the information on them:

* Vision impairment
People with low or no vision may use an assistive device such as a screen reader, Braille display, or a screen magnifier to get content from the screen. They may also simply use the browser’s text zoom function to make the text large enough to read.
* Mobility impairment
Users with limited or no use of their hands may use special devices such as modified mice and keyboards, foot pedals, voice commands, or joy- sticks to navigate the web and enter information.
* Auditory impairment
Users with limited or no hearing will miss out on audio aspects of mul- timedia, so it is necessary to provide alternatives, such as transcripts for audio tracks or captions for video.
* Cognitive impairment
Users with memory, reading comprehension, problem solving, and atten- tion limitations benefit when sites are designed simply and clearly. These qualities are helpful to anyone using your site.


The W3C started the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to address the need to make the web usable for everyone. The WAI site (www.w3.org/WAI) is an excellent starting point for learning more about web accessibility. One of the documents produced by the WAI to help developers create accessible sites is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG and WCAG 2.0). You can read them all at www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php.

Another W3C effort is the WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) spec, which addresses the accessibility of web applications that include dynamically generated content, scripting, and advanced interface ele- ments that are particularly confounding to assistive devices. 

## the need for speed (site performance)

Although the number of users accessing the internet on slow dial-up connec- tions is shrinking (3–5% in the US as of this writing), the percentage of folks using mobile phones to access the web is increasing dramatically; and for some sectors, such as social media and search, mobile has already exceeded desktop usage. If you have a smartphone, then you know how frustrating it is to wait for a web page to fully display over a cellular data connection.

Site performance is critical regardless of how your users access your site. A study by Google in 20091 showed that the addition of just 100 to 400 milli- seconds to their search results page resulted in reduced searches (–0.2 to –0.6%). Amazon.com showed that reducing page load times by just 100ms resulted in a 1% increase in revenue.2 Other studies show that users expect a site to load in under 2 seconds, and nearly a third of your audience will leave your site for another if it doesn’t. Furthermore, those people aren’t likely to come back. Google has added site speed to its search algorithm, so if your site is a slowpoke, it’s not likely to show up in that coveted first screen of results. The takeaway here is that site performance (down to the millisecond!) mat- ters a lot

There are many things you can do to improve the performance of your site, and they fall under two broad categories: limiting file sizes and reducing the number of requests to the server. The following list only scratches the surface for site optimization, but it gives you a general idea of what can be done:

* Optimize images so they are the smallest file size possible without sacri- ficing quality. You’ll learn image optimization techniques in Chapter 24, Image Asset Production.
* StreamlineHTMLmarkup,avoidingunnecessarylevelsofnestedelements.
* Minimize HTML and CSS documents by removing extra character spaces and line returns.
* Keep JavaScript to a minimum.
* Add scripts in such a way that they load in parallel with other page assets and don’t block rendering.
* Don’t load unnecessary assets (such as images, scripts, or JavaScript libraries).
* Reduce the number of times the browser makes requests of the server (known as HTTP requests).
 

If you’d like to see for yourself, you can use the Network tool available with the Developer tools in Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. The Network tool displays each request to the server and how many milliseconds it took

network -> show waterfall chart

Google’s PageSpeed Insights (developers.google.com/ speed/pagespeed/insights/) is another service that analyzes the performance of any site you point it to. It also generates suggestions for making your page load faster.

High Performance Mobile Web: Best Practices for Optimizing Mobile Web Apps by Maximiliano Firtman (O’Reilly) covers optimization methods and tools to check your progress.

Google’s site Make the Web Faster (code.google.com/speed/) is an excellent first stop for learning about site optimization. It compiles a number of excellent tutorials and articles as well as tools for measuring site speed.


## Creating a simple page (HTML overview)

### a web page, step-by-step

html naming conventions

Use proper suffixes for your files. HTML files must end with .html or .htm. Web graphics must be labeled according to their file format: .gif, .png, .jpg (.jpeg is also acceptable, although less common), or .svg.

Never use character spaces within filenames. It is common
to use an underline character or hyphen to visually separate words within filenames, such as robbins_bio.html or robbins- bio.html.

Avoid special characters such as ?, %, #, /, :, ;, •, etc. Limit filenames to letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods. It is also best to avoid international characters, such as the Swedish å.

Filenames may be case-sensitive, depending on your server configuration. Consistently using all lowercase letters in filenames, although not required, is one way to make your filenames easier to manage.

Keep filenames short. Long names are more likely to be misspelled, and short names shave a few extra bytes off the file size. If you really must give the file a long, multiword name, you can separate words with hyphens, such as a-long-document-title.html, to improve readability.

Self-imposed conventions. It is helpful to develop a consistent naming scheme for huge sites—for instance, always using lowercase with hyphens between words. This takes some of the guesswork out of remembering what you named a file when you go to link to it later.

A tag consists of the ele- ment name (usually an abbreviation of a longer descriptive name) within angle brackets (< >)

The tags added around content are referred to as the markup. It is important to note that an element consists of both the content and its markup (the start and end tags). Not all elements have content, however. Some are empty by definition, such as the img element used to add an image to the page. We’ll talk about empty elements a little later in this chapter.

* I don’t want to confuse things, but the first line in the example isn’t an element at all. It is a document type declaration (also called DOCTYPE declaration) that lets modern browsers know which HTML specification to use to interpret the document. This DOCTYPE identifies the docu- ment as written in HTML5.
* The entire document is contained within an html element. The html ele- ment is called the root element because it contains all the elements in the document, and it may not be contained within any other element.
* Within the html element, the document is divided into a head and a body. The head element contains elements that pertain to the document that are not rendered as part of the content, such as its title, style sheets, scripts, and metadata.
* meta elements provide document metadata, information about the docu- ment. In this case, it specifies the character encoding (a standardized collection of letters, numbers, and symbols) used in the document as Unicode version UTF-8 (see the sidebar “Introducing Unicode”). I don’t want to go into too much detail on this right now, but know that there are many good reasons for specifying the charset in every document, so I have included it as part of the minimal document markup. Other types of metadata provided by the meta element are the author, keywords, publish- ing status, and a description that can be used by search engines.
* Also in the head is the mandatory title element.According to the HTML specification, every document must contain a descriptive title.
* Finally, the body element contains everything that we want to show up in the browser window.

In the early days of computing, computers used limited character sets such as ASCII that contained 128 characters (letters from Latin languages, numbers, and common symbols). The early web used the Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) character encoding that included 256 Latin characters from most Western languages. But given the web was “worldwide,” it was clearly not sufficient.
Enter Unicode. Unicode (also called the Universal Character Set) is a super-character set that contains over 136,000 characters (letters, numbers, symbols, ideograms, logograms, etc.) from all active modern languages. You can read all about it at unicode.org. Unicode has three standard encodings—UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32—that differ in the number of bytes used to represent the characters (1, 2, or 3, respectively).

Your server also needs to be configured to identify HTML documents as UTF-8 in the HTTP header (information about the document that the server sends to the user agent). You can ask your server administrator to confirm the encoding of the HTML documents.

A title element is not only required for every document, but it is also quite useful. The title is what is displayed in a user’s Bookmarks or Favorites list and on tabs in desktop browsers. Descriptive titles are also
a key tool for improving accessibility, as they are the first things a person hears when using a screen reader
(an assistive device that reads the content of a page aloud for users with impaired sight). Search engines rely heavily on document titles as well.

title with less than 20 characters , meaningfull names.

The purpose of HTML is to add meaning and structure to the content. 

Your job when marking up content is to choose the HTML element that pro- vides the most meaningful description of the content at hand. In the biz, we call this semantic markup. For example, the most important heading at the beginning of the document should be marked up as an h1 because it is the most important heading on the page

In addition to adding meaning to content, the markup gives the document structure. The way elements follow each other or nest within one another cre- ates relationships between them. You can think of this structure as an outline (its technical name is the DOM, for Document Object Model)


That is because by default, headings and paragraphs display as block elements. Browsers treat block elements as though they are in little rectangular boxes, 

That is because the em element is an inline element (also called a text-level semantic element or phrasing element). Inline elements do not start new lines; they just go with the flow.

All browsers have their own built-in style sheets (called user agent style sheets in the spec) that describe the default rendering of elements. The default rendering is similar from browser to browser (for example, h1s are always big and bold), but there are some variations (the blockquote element for long quotes may or may not be indented).

### empty elements

A handful of elements, however, do not have content because they are used to provide a simple directive. These elements are said to be empty. The image element (img) is an example of an empty element. It tells the browser to get an image file from the server and insert it at that spot in the flow of the text. Other empty elements include the line break (br), thematic breaks (hr, a.k.a. “horizontal rules”), and elements that provide information about a document but don’t affect its displayed content, such as the meta element that we used earlier.

The syntax for an attribute is as follows:

```html
attributename="value"
```
Attributes go after the element name, separated by a space. In non-empty ele-
ments, attributes go in the opening tag only:

```html
<element attributename="value">
<element attributename="value">Content</element>
```
Attributes are instructions that clarify or modify an element.

You can also put more than one attribute in an element in any order. Just keep them separated with spaces:

```html
<element attribute1="value" attribute2="value">
```  

you may see empty elements
with extra slashes at the end, like so:<img />,<br />,<meta />, and <hr />. That indicates the document was written according
to the stricter rules of XHTML.

* Most attributes take values, which follow an equals sign (=). In HTML, some attribute values are single descriptive words. For example, the checked attribute, which makes a form checkbox checked when the form loads, is equivalent to checked="checked". You may hear this type of attribute called a Boolean attribute because it describes a feature that is either on or off.
*  A value might be a number, a word, a string of text, a URL, or a measure- ment, depending on the purpose of the attribute. You’ll see examples of all of these throughout this book.
*  Wrapping attribute values in double quotation marks is a strong conven- tion, but note that quotation marks are not required and may be omitted. In addition, either single or double quotation marks are acceptable as long as the opening and closing marks match. Note that quotation marks in HTML files need to be straight ("), not curly (”).
*  The attribute names and values available for each element are defined in the HTML specifications; in other words, you can’t make up an attribute for an element.
*  Some attributes are required, such as the src and alt attributes in the img element. The HTML specification also defines which attributes are required in order for the document to be valid.

### VALIDATING YOUR DOCUMENTS

To validate a document is to check your markup to make sure that you have abided by all the rules of whatever version of HTML you are using. Documents that are error-free are said to be valid. It is strongly recommended that you validate your documents, especially for professional sites. Valid documents are more consistent on a variety of browsers, they display more quickly, and they are more accessible.

Instead, use a validator, software that checks your source against the HTML version you specify. These are some of the things validators check for:

* The inclusion of a DOCTYPE declaration. Without it the validator doesn’t know which version of HTML to validate against:
* An indication of the character encoding for the document.
* The inclusion of required rules and attributes.
* Non-standardelements.
* Mismatchedtags.
* Nesting errors (incorrectly putting elements inside other elements).
* Typos and other minor errors.

The best web-based validator is at html5.validator.nu. There you can upload a file or provide a link to a page that is already online.

Built-in browser developer tools for Safari and Chrome also have validators so you can check your work on the fly. Some code editors have validators built in as well.

## Chapter 5 - marking up text

I want to reiterate how important it is to choose elements semantically—that is, in a way that most accurately describes the content’s meaning. If you don’t like how it looks, change it with a style sheet. A semantically marked-up document ensures your content is available and accessible in the widest range of browsing environments, from desktop computers and mobile devices to assistive screen readers. It also allows non-human readers, such as search engine indexing programs, to cor- rectly parse your content and make decisions about the relative importance of elements on the page.

### Paragraphs

```html
<p>...</p>
```

Visual browsers nearly always display paragraphs on new lines with a bit of space between them by default (to use a term from CSS, they are displayed as a block). Paragraphs may contain text, images, and other inline elements (called phrasing content), but they may not contain headings, lists, sectioning elements, or any elements that typically display as blocks by default.

### headings

When you add headings to content, the browser uses them to cre- ate a document outline for the page. Assistive reading devices such as screen readers use the document outline to help users quickly scan and navigate through a page. In addition, search engines look at heading levels as part of their algorithms (information in higher heading levels may be given more weight).

```html
 <h1>...</h1>
 <h2>...</h2>
 <h3>...</h3>
 <h4>...</h4>
 <h5>...</h5>
 <h6>...</h6>
```

### THEMATIC BREAKS (HORIZONTAL RULE)

If you want to indicate that one topic has completed and another one is beginning, you can insert what the spec calls a “paragraph-level thematic break” with the hr element. The hr element adds a logical divider between sections of a page or paragraphs without introducing a new heading level.

In older HTML versions, hr was defined as a “horizontal rule” because it inserts a horizontal line on the page. Browsers still render hr as a 3-D shaded rule and put it on a line by itself with some space above and below by default; but in the HTML5 spec, it has a new semantic name and definition. If a deco- rative line is all you’re after, it is better to create a rule by specifying a colored border before or after an element with CSS.


```html
<hr>
```

### Lists

Unordered lists
  Collections of items that appear in no particular order

Just about any list of examples, names, components, thoughts, or options qualifies as an unordered list. In fact, most lists fall into this category. By default, unordered lists display with a bullet before each list item, but you can change that with a style sheet, as you’ll see in a moment.


```html
<ul>
  <li>Serif</li> 
  <li>Sans-serif</li> 
  <li>Script</li> 
  <li>Display</li> 
  <li>Dingbats</li>
</ul>
```

Ordered lists
  Lists in which the sequence of the items is important

Ordered lists are for items that occur in a particular order, such as step-by- step instructions or driving directions. 

```html
<ol>
  <li>Gutenberg develops moveable type (1450s)</li> 
  <li>Linotype is introduced (1890s)</li> 
  <li>Photocomposition catches on (1950s)</li> 
  <li>Type goes digital (1980s)</li>
</ol>
```

If you want a numbered list to start at a number other than 1, you can use the start attribute in the ol element to specify another starting number, as shown here:

```html
<ol start="17">
```

Nesting Lists

```html
<ol>
    <li></li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li> 
</ol>
```

You can use the list-style-type style sheet property to change the bullets and numbers for lists.

Description lists
  Lists that consist of name and value pairs, including but not limited to terms and definitions


<dl>...</dl>
A description list
<dt>...</dt>
A name, such as a term or label
<dd>...</dd>
A value, such as a description or definition

Description lists are used for any type of name/value pairs, such as terms and their definitions, questions and answers, or other types of terms and their associated information


```html
<dl>
  <dt>Linotype</dt>
  <dd>Line-casting allowed type to be selected, used, then recirculated into the machine automatically. This advance increased the speed of typesetting and printing dramatically.</dd>
  <dt>Serif examples</dt> 
  <dd>Baskerville</dd> 
  <dd>Goudy</dd>
<dl>
```

### Long Quotations

If you have a long quotation, a testimonial, or a section of copy from another source, mark it up as a blockquote element. It is recommended that content within blockquote elements

```html
 <blockquote>
  <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
  <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each conductor interprets that score   differently. There is tension in the interpretation.</p>
</blockquote>
```

There is also the inline element q for short quotations in the flow of text. We’ll talk about it later in this chapter.

### Preformatted Text

In the previous chapter, you learned that browsers ignore whitespace such as line returns and character spaces in the source document. But in some types of information, such as code examples or certain poems, the whitespace is important for conveying meaning. For content in which whitespace is seman- tically significant, use the preformatted text (pre) element. It is a unique ele- ment in that it is displayed exactly as it is typed—including all the carriage returns and multiple character spaces

The white-space:pre CSS property can also be used to preserve spaces and returns in the source.

```html
<pre>
This is       an    example of
      text with a lot of
              whitespace.
</pre>  
```

### Figures

The figure element identifies content that illustrates or supports some point in the text. A figure may contain an image, a video, a code snippet, text, or even a table—pretty much anything that can go in the flow of web content. Content in a figure element should be treated and referenced as a self- contained unit. That means if a figure is removed from its original placement in the main flow (to a sidebar or appendix, for example), both the figure and the main flow should continue to make sense.

Although you can simply add an image to a page, wrapping it in figure tags makes its purpose explicitly clear semantically. It also works as a hook for applying special styles to figures but not to other images on the page:

If you want to provide a text caption for the figure, use the figcaption ele- ment above or below the content inside the figure element.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="piechart.png" alt="chart showing fonts on mobile devices">
</figure>

<figure>
  <pre> 
    <code>
      body {
        background-color: #000;
        color: red;
      }
      </code>
  </pre>
  <figcaption>Sample CSS rule.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Organizing page content

So far, the elements we’ve covered handle very specific tidbits of content: a paragraph, a heading, a figure, and so on. Prior to HTML5, there was no way to group these bits into larger parts other than wrapping them in a generic division (div) element (I’ll cover div in more detail later). 

HTML5 introduced new elements that give semantic meaning to sections of a typical web page or application (see Note), including main content (main), headers (header),footers (footer), sections (section), articles (article), navigation (nav), and tan- gentially related or complementary content (aside). Curiously, the spec lists the old address element as a section as well, so we’ll look at that one here too.

Nearly all browsers today support the HTML5 semantic elements, and for those that don’t, creating a style sheet rule that tells browsers to format each one as a block- level element is all you need to make them behave correctly

Unfortunately, that fix won’t work for the small fraction of users who are still using Internet Explorer versions 8 and earlier (less than 1.5% of browser traffic as of 2017)

he solution is to use JavaScript to create each element so IE knows it exists and will allow nesting and styling. Here’s what a JavaScript command creating the section element looks like:

    documencreateElement("section");

Fortunately, Remy Sharp wrote a script that creates all of the HTML5 elements for IE8 and earlier in one fell swoop. It is called “HTML5 Shiv” (or Shim) and it is available on a server that you can point to in your documents. Just copy this code in the head of your document and use a style sheet to style the new elements as blocks:

<!--[if lt IE 9]> → <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5shiv/3.7.3/ html5shiv.min.js">
</script >
<![endif]-->

The HTML5 Shiv is also part of the Modernizr polyfill script that adds HTML5 and CSS3 functionality to older non-supporting browsers

### Main Content

Use the main element to identify the primary content of a page or application. The content of a main element should be unique to that page.

```html
<body> <header>...</header> <main>
  <h1>Humanist Sans Serif</h1>
  <!-- code continues -->
</main>
</body>
```

The W3C HTML5 specification states that pages should have only one main section and that it should not be nested within an article, aside, header, footer, or nav. Doing so will cause the document to be invalid.

### Headers and Footers

The header element is used for introductory material that typically appears at the beginning of a web page or at the top of a section or article (we’ll get to those elements next). There is no specified list of what a header must or should contain; anything that makes sense as the introduction to a page or section is acceptable. In the following example, the document header includes a logo image, the site title, and navigation:

```html
<body>
<header>
  <img src="/images/logo.png" alt="logo"> 
  <h1>Nuts about Web Fonts</h1>
  <nav> 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li> <li><a href="/">Blog</a></li> <li><a href="/">Shop</a></li>
    </ul> 
  </nav>
</header>
<!--page content-->
</body>
```

When used in an individual article, the header might include the article title, author, and the publication date, as shown here:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>More about WOFF</h1>
    <p>by Jennifer Robbins, <time datetime="2017-11-11">November 11, 2017</time></p>
  </header>
  <!-- article content here -->
</article>
```
Neither header nor footer elements are permitted to contain nested header or footer elements.

The footer element is used to indicate the type of information that typi- cally comes at the end of a page or an article, such as its author, copyright information, related documents, or navigation. The footer element may apply to the entire document, or it could be associated with a particular section or article. If the footer is contained directly within the body element, either before or after all the other body content, then it applies to the entire page or application. If it is contained in a sectioning element (section, article, nav, or aside), it is parsed as the footer for just that section. 

```html
<article>
    <header>
      <h1>h1 header</h1>
      <p>by Jennifer Robbins, <time datetime="2017-11-11">November 11, 2017</time></p>
  </header>
  <!-- article content here -->
  <footer>
    <p><small>Copyright &copy;2017 Jennifer Robbins.</small></p>
    <nav> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Previous</a></li>
        <li><a href="/">Next</a></li> 
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </footer>
</article>
```

### Sections and Articles

Long documents are easier to use when they are divided into smaller parts. For example, books are divided into chapters, and newspapers have sections for local news, sports, comics, and so on. To divide long web documents into thematic sections, use the aptly named section element. Sections typically include a heading (inside the section element) plus content that has a mean- ingful reason to be grouped together.

The section element has a broad range of uses, from dividing a whole page into major sections or identifying thematic sections within a single article. In the following example, a document with information about typography resources has been divided into two sections based on resource type:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Typography Books</h2> 
  <ul>
   <li>...</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Online Tutorials</h2>
  <p>These are the best tutorials on the web.</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

The HTML5 spec recommends that if the purpose for grouping the elements is simply to provide a hook for styling, use the generic div element instead.

Use the article element for self-contained works that could stand alone or be reused in a different context (such as syndication). It is useful for maga- zine or newspaper articles, blog posts, comments, or other items that could be extracted for external use. You can think of it as a specialized section ele- ment that answers “yes” to the question “Could this appear on another site and make sense?”

Conversely, a section in a web document might be composed of a number of articles:

```html
<article>
  <h1>Get to Know Helvetica</h1> 
  <section>
    <h2>History of Helvetica</h2>
    <p>...</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Helvetica Today</h2> <p>...</p>
  </section>
</article>

<section id="essays">
  <article>
    <h1>A Fresh Look at Futura</h1> <p>...</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h1>Getting Personal with Humanist</h1> <p>...</p>
  </article>
</section>
```

The section and article elements are easily confused, particularly because it is possible to nest one in the other and vice versa. Keep in mind that if the content is self-contained and could appear outside the current context, it is best marked up as an article.

### Aside (Sidebars)

The aside element identifies content that is separate from, but tangentially related to, the surrounding content. In print, its equivalent is a sidebar, but it couldn’t be called “sidebar” because putting something on the “side” is a presentational description, not semantic. Nonetheless, a sidebar is a good mental model for using the aside element. aside can be used for pull quotes, background information, lists of links, callouts, or anything else that might be associated with (but not critical to) a document.

In this example, an aside element is used for a list of links related to the main article:

```html
<h1>Web Typography</h1>
<p>Back in 1997, there were competing font formats and tools for making them...</p>
<p>We now have a number of methods for using beautiful fonts on web pages...</p>
<aside>
  <h2>Web Font Resources</h2> 
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://typekit.com/">Typekit</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a></li> 
  </ul>
</aside>
```

The aside element has no default rendering, so you will need to make it a block element and adjust its appearance and layout with style sheet rules.

### Navigation 

The nav element gives developers a semantic way to identify navigation for a site. Earlier in this chapter

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Serif</a></li> 
    <li><a href="/">Sans-serif</a></li> 
    <li><a href="/">Script</a></li> 
    <li><a href="/">Display</a></li> 
    <li><a href="/">Dingbats</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### Addresses

he address element that is used to create an area for contact information for the author or maintainer of the document. It is gener- ally placed at the end of the document or in a section or article within a docu- ment. An address would be right at home in a footer element.

```html
<address>
Contributed by <a href="../authors/robbins/">Jennifer Robbins</a>, 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a>
</address>
```

Document Outlines

Behind the scenes, browsers look at the markup in a document and generate a hierarchical outline based on the headings in the content

In past versions of HTML, that was the only way the outline was created. HTML5 introduced a new outline algorithm that enables authors to explicitly add a new section to the outline by inserting a sectioning element: article, section, aside, and nav. In addition to the four sectioning elements, the spec defines some elements (blockquote, fieldset, figure, dialog, details, and td) as sectioning roots, which means headings in those elements do not become part of the overall document outline.

### The inline element roundup

Now that we’ve identified the larger chunks of content, we can provide semantic meaning to phrases within the chunks by using what the HTML5 specification calls text-level semantic elements. On the street, you are likely to hear them called inline elements because they display in the flow of text by default and do not cause any line breaks. That’s also how they were referred to in HTML versions prior to HTML5.

### Emphasized text - em

Use the em element to indicate which part of a sentence should be stressed or emphasized.

Emphasized text (em) elements nearly always display in italics by default (FIGURE 5-9), but of course you can make them display any way you like with a style sheet. Screen readers may use a different tone of voice to convey stressed content, which is why you should use an em element only when it makes sense semantically, not just to achieve italic text.

### Important text - strong

The strong element indicates that a word or phrase is important, serious, or urgent.
Visual browsers typically display strong text elements in bold text by default. Screen readers may use a distinct tone of voice for important content, mark text as strong only when it makes sense semantically, not just to make text bold.


```html
<p><em>Arlo</em> is very smart.</p>
<p>When returning the car, <strong>drop the keys in the red box by the front desk</strong>.</p>
```
